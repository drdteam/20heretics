===================
Misaligned textures
===================
-The brick walls on the outside of the house at the start.
Doing Ctrl+A on linedef 242 should do the trick.

-The wooden roof of the house. Ctrl+A linedef 919.

-The stone roof above the entrance. Ctrl+A linedef 1255's upper texture.

-The 4 stone pillars that support the aforementioned roof. They may or may
not need Ctrl+A. They seem to look okay either way. So it's up to you.

-The first stairs on the right as you enter the house. Ctrl+A linedef 75.

-The second stairs through the left door.
Ctrl+A line 297. Ctrl+A line 261. Ctrl+A line 582. And Ctrl+A line 286.

-The third stairs through the second door that opens when flipping the
first switch. Ctrl+A line 313. And Ctrl+A line 317.

-The basement stairs #3 leads to. The brick wall down there doesn't align
perfectly. First align the banner with the neighboring walls by selecting
lines 370, 631 (the banner) & 632 then Ctrl+A 631. Deselect everything then
Ctrl+A line 370 then Ctrl+A line 632.

-The four wooden pillars in the same basement may benefit from Ctrl+A-ing
them, although they don't look bad as they are right now. Again, up to you.

-The next room is the 'secret' library that opens when you press the second
switch on one of the wooden pillars. To put it simple, all the
brick walls here (that have texture BRKWAL48) need Ctrl+A treatment.

-The passageway behind the bookshelf that opens when pressing the
secret-not-secret book. Ctrl+A linedef 482 to align the walls here.

-The blue brick room the passageway leads to. For the walls,
first Ctrl+A linedef 465. Then select linedef 460 and set
its front side left upper scale to 1.15

-The "brick bathtub" in the blue brick room. Ctrl+A linedef 462.

-The blue brick room also has pillars where Ctrl+A is optional.

-The bottom of the stairs past the yellow key door.
First select lines 835 & 836 then Ctrl+A 835.

-The basement at the bottom of the aforementioned stairs.
Ctrl+A linedef 738.

-The two stairs that lead to the outside from the aforementioned basement.
Ctrl+A linedef 923. And Ctrl+A linedef 926. (Because it bothers me.)

-The little graveyard outside and to the left of the aforementioned basement.
The lower bricks. Ctrl+A linedef 992. And Ctrl+A linedef 987.

-The graveyard fence. Ctrl+A linedef 1271. Both sides.

-I suppose you could Ctrl+A the leaf/hedge maze walls as well, but since it's
dark and it's supposed to be leafs/hedge maze, it's not really worth it.
Especially considering the bit at the end where only one path leads to the
maulotaur while the others loop back inside. Up to you.

-Finally, the bricks making up the structure where the maulotaur is
(not including the little cubicle that lowers when pressing the switch).
Shift+A linedef 1125. (Only align Y).
The pillars might need some attention, although they look okay as they are.
Can't exactly Ctrl+A one line here without messing up the rest since it's
all one texture. How you want to go about it is up to you.

===================
Missing textures / HOM
===================
-Lines 702 & 703. (The bathtub you teleport to.)

===================
Gameplay exploits
===================
-In the final area, linedef 1126 is the one that seals you off from
the rest of the map so you can't escape the maulotaur.
It's possible to avoid triggering that line by jumping on the
ledge and walking around the pillars.

-You can also rocket jump with the phoenix rod across the green brick wall
thus avoiding the maulotaur fight entirely.

===================
Suggestions
===================
-All lines that use texture MIDBAR07 (the fences) should have a Y (right) offset
of -6 so as to close the lower gap and 'connect' the fence to the floor.

-The three exit lines next to the boat can be avoided if you know where they
are thus you can end up in the river or on the boat and you still haven't left
the map. I suggest linedef 45 to be the exit line because that one's unavoidable.
