[MAP07]
!! CRITICAL !!

** COSMETIC **
Starting area, far left corner, where the brown rock meets the building and the brown/grey overcrop, the textures are misaligned.
Idem right side.
Sky hack on the wedjat decoration above the door means it vanishes behind nothing from certain angles.
Decorated ceiling overcrops inside the tomb has misaligned texture on the juncture between the pillar room and the sphinx switch room.
Idem on the other juncture.
Pillars in the corridor in which you get trapped between two weredragons have misaligned textures.
Bricks in the mummy ambush room (the big bricks, not the small ones in the closets) are misaligned.
Bricks in the lava pit room's corridors to the teleport are misaligned.

?? GAMEPLAY ??
Imo the pattern wall should be displayed closer to the pit puzzle.

[MAP08]
neat


[MAP09]
!! CRITICAL !!

** COSMETIC **
Rock walls in the starting area are misaligned.
The water outside isn't set to have horizon lines, instead it's just a floating square over the world's biggest dirt patch.
The bungalows need some serious texture variety.
Rocks in the tunnel you can access from the small well in the final room are misaligned.

?? GAMEPLAY ??
I'd make the water a bit more transparent becaus I honestly thought it was a hard flat until I accidentally fell into it!
The message when you try to leave the area is misspelled. It should be "Maybe it's not a good idea to leave this settlement.."

[MAP10]
!! CRITICAL !!

** COSMETIC **
Putting a switch inside a flat statue texture in the green key room looks plain weird. I'd use a different tex or put the switch elsewhere.

?? GAMEPLAY ??
Only one question mark is necessary, pitful mortal!
