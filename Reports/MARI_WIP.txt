As you can see this isn't finished yet. There are still many rooms unfinished.

Stuff left to do:
 - Ground floor hallways, music room, study, guest bedrooms, servant quarters,
   kitchen, library, trophy room, vault, storerooms, gardens, chapel.
 - Basement guard barracks (partial), prison, tomb (boss fight arena).
 - Detail area outside map, need more buildings to block the view and make it
   look like an actual town.

Stuff done since last update:
 - Reduced VM overhead by about 90% by restricting the sound system to just
   ambience and making many lights and sounds static. Map now runs smoothly
   even on my puny little GPD Pocket.
 - Unified normal lights and toggled lights, reducing the number of
   unique decorative actors.
 - Added brightmaps.
 - Louder knock sound.
 - Readjusted closet setpiece to prevent sequence breaking (hopefully).
