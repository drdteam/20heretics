As you can see this isn't finished yet. There are still many rooms unfinished.

Stuff left to do:
 - Ground floor hallways, music room, study, guest bedrooms, servant quarters,
   kitchen, library, trophy room, vault, storerooms, gardens, chapel.
 - Basement guard barracks (partial), prison, tomb (boss fight arena).
 - Detail area outside map, need more buildings to block the view and make it
   look like an actual town.
