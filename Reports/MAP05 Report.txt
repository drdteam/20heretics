[MAP05]
!! CRITICAL


* COSMETIC
[Addressed] Ship could use some visual clutter.

* GAMEPLAY
[Not sure what I want to do with this] lootbox lol, but really, they give you a ton of stuff and I think it breaks the balance a bit

[Fixed] The ophidians in their little towers never shoot because they can't find clearance, and they're also really hard to hit.
