[MAP03]
!! CRITICAL


* COSMETIC
Map could use a bit more decorative clutter in general.
General misaligns on the outside of the building's brick walls.
The walls of the archway that leads to the stairs in the room with the poker table has wrong textures on its sides and stair-side
Water in the bathtub causes the edges of said tub to look all fucky because it uses transfer heights instead of being a 3d floor.

* GAMEPLAY
Maulotaur area needs a bit of health and a bit of ammo, EPSECIALLY if you missed the phoenix rod and hellstaff..
