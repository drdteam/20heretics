[MAP02]
!! CRITICAL
Nothing happens after I kill the iron lich. This means the map can't be completed.
I also cannot go back up the slope because it's too high.
* COSMETIC
Mossy bricks in the small graveyard with the yellow key door are misaligned.
Same on the other side of the map, with the sloped area.
And after the yellow gate.
And the graveyard after it where you meet the ghost knights.
And the one where the blue key is.

* GAMEPLAY
The ghost dog needs a health nerf, he takes a ton of shots to kill and is kind of really tough in general.
