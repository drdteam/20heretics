[MAP01]

* COSMETIC
Torches in starting room float in the air, should be closer to the walls.
Arch that leads outside towards the boxes has a texture mismatch on the inner side (grey bricks instead of green)
On the right of the grate right after the box when you come out of the first room, there is a texture misalignment on the angled green brick wall.
Green bricks on the side of the staircase aren't aligned with the rest of the building.
The pad on which the Morph Ovum is has a badly placed pillar that should be further on the left.
There is an alcove with a TB of the Ancients which has a decorated part causing a texture alignment mismatch
Textures on the outer walls of the building where you find the morph ovum seem a bit random with no real reason
The building with the ghost knight has a TB of the A next to two brazeros, one has a flag and the other doesn't and it looks really jarring imo?
The exit of the room with the red bridge that leads to the buildings mentioned above has a tons of flags above its exit, I'd make only two columns instead of four
An alcove near the fountain that has four heretic statues and a wand gem has a green brick pillar that is misaligned
Another alcove a bit further has the same problem but worse (this one has a TBofA) The metal pillar is also misaligned because it's too wide for its texture
Directly opposite of that alcove you have a building with a window that gives on a chandelier, the wall under this window is badly misaligned
The building that has the skullstaff has a misaligned wall right behind said skullstaff
Maulotaur room has misaligned metal supports on the right of the entrance, metal parts around the stained glass windows could be more elegantly aligned as well
The water horizon just looks wrong since it suddenly stops into rock with no delineation at all
The rock formations in the waterfall area, as well as the cliffs that lead into the ponds have misaligned textures
The green wall around the staircase that leads to the blue key door also has misaligned textures on its outer side, not just the inner

* GAMEPLAY
The first undead knight on the ledge is easy to fall off.
The shield should be tagged as secret since getting to it isn't really obvious.
Why do you have MACE SPHERES in the level, of all things???
Hellstaff should also be a secret since it requires SOME thinking to get
Maulotaur is kind of stupidly strong for this early in the pack, I'd use an iron lich instead imo
the room he's in also needs more health, and the ghost knights are kind of a dick move
The tome at the end is completely useless since you already killed the maulotaur
There is a bunch of junk put high up, like a life urn and such, that cannot be obtained and thus serve no purpose at all
