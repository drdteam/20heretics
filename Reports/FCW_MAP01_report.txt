Played on skill 4 (smite-meister)

=============
Texture misalignments
=============
-At the start, there are two pillars with all their textures unaligned. It seems
intentional, though.

-Move outside towards the wooden crates, turn around and look up.

The green brick texture (linedef 72) isn't perfectly aligned with the rest.

-Seems like most of the green bricks around the start aren't perfectly aligned
horizontally and vertically. I'm not going to pinpoint each end every line
because it's going to get annoying fast. On the other hand, this might be
intentional?

-More misalignments around the first brazier, gray bricks, where the blue door
bridge is. (Start at linedef 488)

-There's even more where the morph ovum can be found. (Start at linedef 647)

-And there's more around linedef 227.

-A little more, linedef 517.

-The well, linedef 212. Both inside and out.

-The little 'house' with no windows nor doors, linedef 150.

-The building with the crossbow, start at linedef 119.

-The other windowless, doorless little 'house', linedef 762. Has another
building next to it with a switch inside.

-The very same building with the switch also has some naughty misalignments.
Outside next to the little 'house' roof.

-A third little 'house' with the teleporter on its roof, start at linedef 800.
(As a side note, I'm also bothered why this one has two SPINE2 textures for
two of its walls while the other two 'houses' don't.)

-Linedef 403, that brown rock area past the little 'houses'.

-The rock pillars right past the aforementioned brown rock area. All three.

-And around linedef 358, the grey rocks right next to the rock pillars.

-There's more where you fight the maulotaur.

-I probably missed a few more places but overall this map has a lot of
misaligned textures.

=============
Missing textures which aren't part of the old F_SKY hack.
=============
-The ones you can see during normal gameplay and not using cheats.
Linedef 910

-The rest:
Linedef 323
Linedef 837
Linedef 838
Linedef 839
Linedef 1528
Linedef 1545
Linedef 1546

=============
Other bugs
=============
-A disciple (thing 117) has translucency. Which is redundant since thanks
to the disciple's AI, he ruins it with his flash-before-attack gimmick.
(It turns off his translucency after attacking.) I suppose you can leave it
be for folks who play this with monster replacing mods.

-Sectors 267 & 268 don't have appropriate floor textures considering they're
supposed to be wooden crates. (Imo it should be FLOOR30 or FLAT508).
And since there is no secret to them I'm guessing this is an oversight.

-Since there is a secret wall that, when lowered, leads to the Mystic Urn
and since this map has no official secrets, I suggest setting sector 293
as secret. (The one right behind the fake wall sector.)

-Linedefs 469 and 471 should be lower unpegged because they are part
of the blue key door, those walls that usually move when the door opens.
(Nobody likes that.)

-Same for linedefs 582 and 584, green key door.

=============
Gameplay exploits
=============
When going towards the blue door, you can jump across the left wall closest to
the door. Is this intentional?
