===================
Misaligned textures
===================
NOTE: I'm making the assumption you're working with GZDB-Bugfix.

-Linedef 596. A simple Ctrl+A won't cut it so for this particular line here's
what you have to do.
Select the neighbor on the right (line 595), set its backside left upper scale
to 0.97 and Ctrl+A that line. Then select 596 and set its backside left upper
scale to 1

-Linedef 545. Again, just doing Ctrl+A isn't good enough. Select this line,
(if in visual mode, select the lower texture to make sure you're selecting 545)
and apply the following to the front side:
Middle offset 60, 0. Lower offset 4, 16. Left lower scale 1.05
The upper texture is a 3D floor which is...

-Linedef 606. If you're in visual mode, just aim at 545's "upper texture" to
select 606. Set 606's front side left middle scale to 1.05. Don't touch its offsets!
(If you did touch them and goofed it, make sure its middle offset is 8, 0.)
NOTE: Trying to set the scale on 545 will not affect the 3D floor texture.
This is why you have to do it on 606.

-The following concerns the rock walls around the exit teleporter.
(I'm very anal about this stuff. You may feel free to ignore this bit. >_>)
Lower sector 99 just a bit so Ctrl+A will work for the next steps.
In visual mode, select lines 557, 562, 558 & 559. Then Ctrl+A 557.
Now select 561, 560 & 563. Then Ctrl+A 561.
Now select 559 and set its front side left lower scale to 0.94
Finally, set sector 99's floor height back to -32.

-The three arches. (One of them has the polyobject doors.)
In visual mode, select lines 230 & 249 then Ctrl+A 230.
Select lines 257 & 248 then Ctrl+A 257.
Select lines 460 & 469 then Ctrl+A 460.
Select lines 464 & 461 then Ctrl+A 464.
Select lines 287 & 320 then Ctrl+A 287.
Select lines 326 & 319 then Ctrl+A 326.

-I can tell that the other misaligned textures are a deliberate cosmetic choice.
Gothic seems to know what he's doing. (Which makes my job easier. :P)
So I'm not going to list them. You can leave those be.

================
Missing textures
================
-While there are missing textures, they are all part of the old
monster-comes-out-of-the-ground visual trick so I'm not going to
list them.

-There's also a 3D floor without a floor or ceiling texture, however
that seems deliberate in order to make it invisible.
It serves to keep the blue key afloat. So leave that be as well.
(Setting the 3D floor's opacity to 0 would have accomplished the
same thing, but whatever.)

================
Gameplay exploits
================
-As leodoom85 has mentioned, the ironlich's tornado attack can propel
you on higher ground, arguably making the fight easier. You might consider
making the surrounding cliffs impassable. (Careful not to block the exit tho.)

================
Other bugs
================
The ACS scripts refer to a non-existent actor called "FakeXplosion".
I believe it's supposed to spawn when the pillars that block you disappear.
I do remember there being something when playing Gothic's map the first time.
Someone forgot to import this FakeXplosion actor.
