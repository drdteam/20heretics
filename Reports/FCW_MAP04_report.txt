===================
Misaligned textures
===================
-In the actual sewer area, check each serpent torch (DoomEd num 27).
You'll notice the walls to the sides of the torches aren't aligned with
their neighbors (the ones with the same texture GRSTNPB). I wonder if it's
intentional?
NOTE: This doesn't include the torch where you start but the ones that
have a GRSTNPBV wall behind them.

-For the cave area I'll just mention the linedefs. I may miss some.
I may omit some due to the fact I know how hard it can be to perfectly
align everything inside a cave.
So...

-Ctrl+A line 1762.
-Select line 324, set its front side left middle scale to 0.85
-Select lines 595 & 609 then Ctrl+A 595.
-Select line 538, set its backside left upper scale to 1.15
-Ctrl+A line 642. Then select 640 & 643, Ctrl+A 640.
-Ctrl+A line 1226.
-Ctrl+A line 335.
-Ctrl+A line 352.
-Ctrl+A line 682.
-Ctrl+A line 437.

===================
Missing textures / HOM
===================
-Linedef 1343

===================
Other bugs
===================
-Thing 199 is out in the void.

-Linedef 1218's backside lower texure is GRSTNPB. It's a line in the cave area.
It probably should be WALL5092.

===================
Gripes
===================
-The ladder at the end was somewhat unintuitive.
On my first playthrough I didn't even know there was a ladder
and spent 5 minutes going back and forth the entire map before
realizing I could climb it. The texture itself doesn't make it
clear it's a ladder imo. Plus the mechanic is kind of alien to
idTech1 games; it's unexpected.
