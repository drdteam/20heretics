Well here you go, PNG Hexen II textures. Some neat stuff here. These would good for, oh I dunno, Heretic or Hexen? :P
Probably Doom as well. Either way, some require either some editing in a paint program or TEXTURES for mirroring.

As far as I know, I got all the garbage (model skins, corrupted shit and so on) out of here, I cleaned up what needed
to be cleaned, aaaaand I'm pretty sure I found most if not all of the animations. Buttons are undefined so you'll need
to do that yourself.

A big thanks to Gez for adding Quake .BSP support to SLADE! --Ceeb
