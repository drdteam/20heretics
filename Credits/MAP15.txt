Thievery at the Forsaken Manor

A spooky map by Marisa Kirisame for the 20 Heretics Challenge.

So, I've decided to go a bit crazy with my submission and make a more
"atmospheric" sort of map, complete with an ambience system inspired by Thief
(the original, not the crappy reboot).

I've done more of my fancy ZScript magic here, solely for that.

Also, I'm using mostly vanilla textures, along with some quick and dirty
TEXTURES hackery because the resource pack crashes SLADE. Shame about that...

Ambient sounds were taken from Thief and Thief 2.

Things that I'll probably do in a "Redux" rerelease after this:
 - New textures
 - Advanced enemy AI, more Thief-like
 - More keys
 - Extra rooms that were cut from this release, along with the second floor
 - Actual statues in the hall of statues
 - Footstep sounds
 - Light and sound mechanics like in Thief
 - Loot
 - Defined objectives
 - Nonlethal combat, water arrows, and much more like in good ol' Thief
