# object sequence listing

# each sequence has an identificative name
# names should be unique, even between ambient and object sequence files

# ---types---
# oneshot: play once
# looping: loops forever
# repeating: repeats, switching between random sounds at random intervals
# repeating2: same as previous, but never plays the same sound two times in a row
# sequential: goes through sounds sequentially using the first interval, then uses second interval for restarting
# sequential2: goes through sounds sequentially but with random interval

# delay is the initial number of tics the sequence waits before playing anything at all

# minimum and maximum interval behave differently depending on the type, but usually a value is picked at random between each for waiting between sounds

# volume is self-explanatory

# attenuation is the strength of the sound's falloff, so the higher it is, the quicker it fades away with distance
# 1.0 is basically a normal attenuation, setting this to 0.0 defeats the purpose of an object sequence, since it'll act like an ambient sequence with pan mode 0

# number of sounds is required because I'm lazy, but this can be removed in the future

# sound names are from SNDINFO, obviously

# sound durations are obligatory for all cases except looping sequences
# this is so the sequence and sounds can be automatically cleaned up when they finish playing
# for now the sound durations have to be provided here, as there currently are no methods for checking if sound is playing from an actor in zscript
# the feature has been requested, though
