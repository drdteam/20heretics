===================
Misaligned textures [Addressed]
===================
-The first area.
For the rock wall select linedef 165 and set its front side left lower scale to 0.95
For the rock path you walk on, first Ctrl+A linedef 100.
Then select the left neighbor linedef 99 and set its front side
left lower scale 1.31

-There was other stuff but I decided to ignore it. Not that noticeable.
(Which, arguable, can be said about the above points as well.)

===================
Missing textures [Addressed, as best I could, that area's glitchy as hell]
===================
-Final area. Lines 1346, 1347, 1348 & 1349.
I don't understand why there is a pillar of missing textures
under the first 3D floor you teleport to. If you fall off and
look at that 3D floor, you'll notice a "sky hole" underneath it.

===================
Quirks [Won't change]
===================
-The first area treasure chest can be opened by the lava balls
hitting it.

===================
Suggestions [Done]
===================
-The second area with the ship. I think Tap said this already, but it
wouldn't be a bad idea to bring the ophidian towers closer to the bridge.
That way you can shoot them easier and they can shoot you easier.
At the moment, they're a bit too far away imho.

-This map could use a little more health. Maybe that's intentional, maybe not.
For instance, the third area could have some blue vials and quartz flasks
here and there since it's right before the final area with the lich and disciples.
